# Overview

The first thing the LAMP charm does is to install and configure a new instance with Apache and PHP5. The charm will then copy any files under `/website`  inside the charm folder structure, into `/var/www`. 

It also allows you to specify a Bazaar branch. It will clone the branch into the webserver and copy the contents to `/var/www`. As an example set:

    juju set lamp website-bzr="lp:~vtuson/+junk/mytodo_web"

You can set up a relationship with a Mysql service. A Mysql database is created by default at this time. You can change the name of the database as a configuration options.

    juju set lamp website-database="your_db_name"

If you provide a file called mysql_config either on the `/website` folder or in the root of you Bazaar branch, this will be used to configure further the Mysql database. PLease note that this file is called every time a new unit is created. For example, item creation should first check if the table exists.

The charm will store the details of the relationship in `/var/webconfig`. In there you can also find opendb.php, a basic script that will open the connection to the MySQL database for you.
